Hi! This is a bot I programmed for my mumble server. It works well for me and my purposes.

I use the dafoxia branch of mumble-ruby: [Github link](https://github.com/dafoxia/mumble-ruby)

MPC needs to be installed to control MPD. This may be changed in the future to rely less on external tools. Mumblecop will automatically turn consume mode on when it is launched.

Rename config-sample.yml to config.yml for it to take effect.

mumblecop.service can be installed as a systemd service and used just like any other. ExecStart and WorkingDirectory MUST be changed. They are dummy values.

Real documentation forthcoming, but for now, if you have any questions or would like to use this please feel free to send me a message, I would love to see this being used by others :)

I MAKE NO GUARANTEE ABOUT SECURITY. I would like to perform many security tests but I do not have the time nor the expert knowledge. Sometimes user input is passed as parameters to system commands (mpc) and it's possible that could be exploited.
