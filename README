Hi! This is a bot I programmed for my mumble server. It works well for me and my purposes.

Features:

* Stream audio from youtube and soundcloud
* Queue based audio setup
* Roll dice
* Write your own commands with a simple plugin format

Installation instructions can be found on the project wiki, [here](https://bitbucket.org/Flandoo/mumblecop/wiki/Home).

If you have any questions or would like to use this please feel free to send me a message, I would love to see this being used by others :)

ALSO if you write any plugins, PLEASE send them to me if you would like them to be considered for inclusion! Thanks!

This project led to the discovery and fix of mpd bug [4264](http://bugs.musicpd.org/view.php?id=4264). Hooray!
