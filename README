Hi! This is a bot I programmed for my mumble server. It works well for me and my purposes.

Features:

* Stream audio from youtube and soundcloud
* Queue based audio setup
* Roll dice
* Write your own commands with a simple plugin format

Installation instructions can be found on the project wiki, [here](https://bitbucket.org/Flandoo/mumblecop/wiki/Home).

If you have any questions, need assistance using this, or just want to say hi please feel free to send me a message. I would love to see this being used by others :)

Also, if you write any plugins, please send them to me/submit a pull request if you would like them to be considered for inclusion! Thanks!

This project led to the discovery and fix of mpd bug [4264](http://bugs.musicpd.org/view.php?id=4264). Hooray!
