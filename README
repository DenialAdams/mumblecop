Hi! This is a bot I programmed for my mumble server. It works well for me and my purposes.

MPD needs to be set up and output to a pipe in /tmp/mpd.fifo. This will be configurable in the future.

MPC needs to be installed to control MPD. This may be changed in the future to rely less on external tools. Robocop will automatically turn consume mode on when it is launched.

Rename config-sample.yml to config.yml for it to take effect.

robocop.service can be installed as a systemd service and used just like any other. ExecStart and WorkingDirectory MUST be changed. They are dummy values.

Real documentation forthcoming, but for now, if you have any questions or would like to use this please feel free to send me a message, I would love to see this being used by others :)
