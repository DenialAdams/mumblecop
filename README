Hi! This is a bot I programmed for my mumble server. It works well for me and my purposes.

I use the dafoxia branch of mumble-ruby: [Github link](https://github.com/dafoxia/mumble-ruby)

MPD needs to be installed for all of the music functionality to work correctly. This will be broken off into an optional plugin soon.

Rename config-sample.yml to config.yml for it to take effect. This must be done.

mumblecop.service can be installed as a systemd service and used just like any other. ExecStart and WorkingDirectory MUST be changed. They are dummy values.

Real documentation forthcoming, but for now, if you have any questions or would like to use this please feel free to send me a message, I would love to see this being used by others :)
