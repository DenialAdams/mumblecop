This is a mumble bot that is engineered for functionality and extensibility. At it's core, it's a collection of mumble-ruby, ruby-mpd and my own work to make it easy to develop plugins that interact with both.

Current release:
This is a pre-release version, API can still change. I plan on releasing 1.0 soon that should have a stable API. This project uses [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org).

Features:

* Stream audio from youtube, soundcloud and online radio with a queue based audio setup
* Roll dice, have countdowns, assign numbers to your users, and use many other utility functions
* Restrict usage with a simple but powerful permissions system
* Write your own commands with a simple plugin format

Installation instructions and more can be found on the project wiki, [here](https://bitbucket.org/Flandoo/mumblecop/wiki/Home).

If you have any questions, need assistance using this, or just want to say hi please feel free to send me a message. I would love to see this being used by others :)
